## Abstract
Stroke causes pronounced and widespread slowing of neural activity. Despite decades
of work exploring these abnormal neural dynamics and their associated functional
impairments, their causes remain largely unclear. To close this gap in understanding,
we applied a neurophysiological corticothalamic circuit model to simulate magnetoencephalography
(MEG) power spectra recorded from chronic stroke patients.
Comparing model-estimated
physiological parameters to those of controls, patients
demonstrated significantly lower intrathalamic inhibition in the lesioned hemisphere,
despite the absence of direct damage to the thalamus itself. We hypothesized that
this disinhibition could instead be related to secondary degeneration of the thalamus,
for which growing evidence exists in the literature. Further analyses confirmed
that spectral slowing correlated significantly with overall secondary degeneration of
the ipsilesional thalamus, encompassing decreased thalamic volume, altered tissue
microstructure, and decreased blood flow. Crucially, this relationship was mediated
by model-estimated
thalamic disinhibition, suggesting a causal link between secondary
thalamic degeneration and abnormal brain dynamics via thalamic disinhibition.
Finally, thalamic degeneration was correlated significantly with poorer cognitive and
language outcomes, but not lesion volume, reinforcing that thalamus damage may
account for additional individual variability in poststroke disability. Overall, our findings
indicate that the frequently observed poststroke slowing reflects a disruption of
corticothalamic circuit dynamics due to secondary thalamic dysfunction, and highlights
the thalamus as an important target for understanding and potentially treating
poststroke brain dysfunction.
